# Simple machine state machine design framework.

A simple state machine design framework for embedded systems.

You can create your own makefile or simply run the shell command to see the application result:

* $gcc.exe main.c exm/* sm/* -o main
* $./main

* I assumed, gcc toolchain was added path in your machine envs.

You can find the UML StateCharts representaion of the implemented machine at the link:
